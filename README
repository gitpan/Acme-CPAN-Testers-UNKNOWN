NAME
    Acme::CPAN::Testers::FalsePositive - Pretending to be
    Acme::CPAN::Testers::UNKNOWN

VERSION
    version 0.03

DESCRIPTION
    This module is being used as an experiment to see what happens when an
    identical distribution name is uploaded to CPAN.

    There is already:

        BINGOS/Acme-CPAN-Testers-UNKNOWN-0.02.tar.gz

    This will have the same name, a different version and different module
    (that will still be indexed).

    We'll see how search engines and RT can cope.
